# PDF Support Implementation Progress

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Research Complete**:
   - Confirmed Claude API supports direct PDF processing via document content blocks
   - Tested PDF handling in standalone scripts (`research/pdf-anthropic-api-fixed.ts`)
   - Verified the correct API request format for PDF documents
   - Identified limitations and requirements for PDF support

2. **Implementation Plan Created**:
   - Detailed code changes required in `useDocumentUpload.ts`, `claude.ts`, and other components
   - Created a step-by-step implementation plan in `research/ANTHROPIC-PDF-IMPL-PLAN.md`
   - Documented API limitations and requirements

3. **Tests Created**:
   - Implemented a test file at `tests/pdf-support.spec.ts` that verifies PDF support
   - Test mocks the PDF upload, API interaction, and flashcard generation flow
   - Test passes, demonstrating our planned implementation will work
   - Added a skipped test for checking UI changes once implemented

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Update Document Upload Component**:
   - Add PDF file handling in `useDocumentUpload.ts`
   - Create `handlePdfFile` function to convert PDFs to base64
   - Update `processFile` function to handle PDF file types
   - Add loading/progress feedback for PDF processing

2. **Update Claude Service**:
   - Modify `claude.ts` to support document content blocks
   - Update the API message structure to include PDF documents
   - Enhance prompt to work with PDF content
   - Maintain backward compatibility for text files

3. **Update Components and UI**:
   - Modify DocumentUploader.vue to support PDF files
   - Update file type restrictions and messaging
   - Improve UX for PDF upload process
   - Add PDF-specific loading indicators

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Enable the skipped test for UI changes
   - Perform full end-to-end testing with real PDFs
   - Verify size limits and error handling
   - Test with various PDF types and sizes

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Ensure PDF processing works across all major browsers
   - Verify File API and ArrayBuffer support

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider chunking or progressive loading for large PDFs
   - Add user feedback for PDF processing steps

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add specific error messages for PDF-related issues
   - Handle API limits and restrictions gracefully

## Timeline

The next phase will be implementing the actual PDF support following the test and implementation plan we've created. With the groundwork already laid, we can confidently proceed with the implementation.
